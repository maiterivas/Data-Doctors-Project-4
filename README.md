## Project Overview
For this project, we will be training a model to analyze a number of symptoms, and give feedback for a predicted disease based off of users' input.

### Dataset Used 
In order to train and test our model, we will be using this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset) created by Pranay Patil. 

### Anticipated tools to be used
Pandas will be used to clean and prepare the data. SciKitLearn will be used to scale the data. We will compare the efficacy of the RandomForestClassifier and the DecisionTreeClassifier. 

### Showcasing Results
Our front end will be an interactive webpage that takes in user provided symptoms and returns a disease that is predicted to be associated with those symptoms. 

### If time
Our webpage will also return a list of resources/further reading for the user to investigate should they want to learn more about the disease. Additionally, we would like to feature a tab with Tableau created visualziations on major disease trends based on our data.
